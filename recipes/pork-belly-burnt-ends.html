    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Melt in your mouth Pork Belly Burnt Ends with your preferred choice in flavor profile (Savory Sweet, Sweet Heat or Ultimate Sweetness)</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 lbs skinless pork belly, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>BBQ dry rub of choice</li>
        <li>BBQ sauce of choice (enough to cover)</li>
        <li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup honey</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, sliced into pats</li>
        <li>½ cup apple juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tools</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>deep aluminum pan (required)</li>
        <li>aluminum foil or aluminum pan cover (required)</li>
        <li>food grade rubber gloves</li>
        <li>cotton glove liners</li>
        <li>stainless steel baking rack(s)</li>
        <li>instant read thermometer</li>
        <li>Spray bottle for spritzing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Coat all sides of the cubed pork belly in the preferred BBQ dry rub.  Place rubbed cubes onto a stainless steel baking rack leaving enough space between each for airflow</li>
        <li>Allow the rub to set (minimum 30 minutes)</li>
        <li>While the rub sets, preheating a smoker to 275°F (135°C).
            <ul>
                <li>A fruit wood, like Cherry or Apple, is recommended.  Other smoke woods may but used if preferred.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Once the smoker is up to temperature, transfer the baking rack into the smoker.  Smoke for approximately 2 hours @ 275°F (135°C).</li>
        <li>(Optional) 1 to 1 ½ into the smoke, spritz the cubes with left over apple juice or apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>At the 2 hour mark, put on cotton glove liners and food grade rubber gloves.  Then carefully check the pork belly for probe tenderness with a instant read thermometer.  The thermometer probe should easily move through the pork belly with little to no resistance.  If the probe meets resistance, allow the pork belly to continue to cook.  Check every 15 minutes until probe tender.  Remove once tender.</li>
        <li>With your gloved hands carefully transfer the pork belly cubes from the baking racks to a deep aluminum pan, large enough for each cube to be arranged uniformly on the same level.</li>
        <li>Cover cubes in preferred BBQ sauce.  Then evenly distribute the dark brown sugar, honey, butter pats, and apple juice.  Ensure the cubes are coated thoroughly</li>
        <li>Cover the aluminum pan with aluminum foil/cover and return to the smoker for 20-30 minutes but no longer then 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 20-30 minutes carefully remote the aluminum pan from the smoker.  With gloved hands, carefully remove the aluminum cover and transfer the cubes from the tray back onto a baking sheet.  Again leaving space for airflow.</li>
        <li>Return the backing rack back to the smoker for another 15-20 minutes to allow the sauce to set.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately for best results</li>
    </ol>
